## Research and Work

### PhytoOracle 

![PO](./assets/PhytoOracle_logo.png){width="128px" height="128px"}

During my time as a graduate student at the University of Arizona, I had the opportunity to assist the PhytoOracle project.

- PhytoOracle is a scalable, distrubted workflow manager developed for analysis of high throughput phenotype data, designed (but not limited!) for processing data from the University of Arizona Gantry (the World's largest agricultural robot). 
- Contributions include: 
    - Building workflows using the [CCTools](https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/downloadfiles.php) foreman-worker framework.
    - Large scale phenotype extraction.
    - Big Data management and processing.

### StarBLAST

Primary maintainer and developer of StarBLAST.

- StarBLAST is a scalable extension of [SequenceServer](http://sequenceserver.com/) BLAST, making BLAST accessible to educators and researchers running classroom-scale searches concurrently. The idea first originated when long queue times would disrupt lectures based on the [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) software, turning educators to look for a solution. StarBLAST was created with this in mind: making BLAST accessible to all levels and sizes of classrooms.
