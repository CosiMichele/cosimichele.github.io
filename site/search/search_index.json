PhytoOracle is a scalable, distrubted workflow manager developed for analysis of high throughput phenotype data, designed (but not limited!) for processing data from the University of Arizona Gantry (the World's largest agricultural robot). Contributions include: Building workflows using the CCTools foreman-worker framework. Large scale phenotype extraction. Big Data management and processing.

StarBLAST is a scalable extension of SequenceServer BLAST, making BLAST accessible to educators and researchers running classroom-scale searches concurrently. The idea first originated when long queue times would disrupt lectures based on the BLAST software, turning educators to look for a solution. StarBLAST was created with this in mind: making BLAST accessible to all levels and sizes of classrooms.
